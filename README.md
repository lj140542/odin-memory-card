# Odin's Memory Card Game

## 🔍 Description
This project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. This project goal was to build a memory card game using React. 

My objectives when building this project were : 
- use an API to fetch new data at each board reset 
- use Suspense to handle what's rendered  while date is being fetched
- use Effect hook
